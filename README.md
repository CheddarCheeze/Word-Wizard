Library that will contain multiple ways to analyze words.

#### LetterStats()
Analyzes a string of characters and returns frequency of every letter and frequency of any couplets, and triplets that occur more than once.
Very useful for cryptography.

Loads a dictionary (takes about 20 seconds). Message will prompt for input. 
Enter a scrambled word and will return a list of possible-unscrambled word results.
This uses the wordlist from UNIX.
